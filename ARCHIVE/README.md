# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical fix documentation that has been consolidated into the main `CHANGELOG.md` file.

## Contents

These documents were created during development to track specific bug fixes and solutions. All relevant information has been preserved in `/proj/CHANGELOG.md` for easy reference.

**Archived Documents:**
- `FIX_CHAT_RLS_COMPLETE.md` - Chat RLS policy fixes
- `FIX_GROUP_MEMBERS_ERROR.md` - Group members loading error fixes
- `FIX_GROUP_MEMBERS_ERRORS.md` - Additional group members error fixes
- `FIX_POSTS_AND_RLS_COMPLETE.md` - Posts and RLS policy fixes
- `FIX_USER_DISPLAY_NAMES.md` - User display name fixes
- `COMPLETE_SOLUTION.md` - Consolidated solution document

## Why Archived?

These documents created confusion due to:
- Overlapping content between multiple documents
- Outdated information mixed with current fixes
- Difficulty determining which document had the latest information
- Maintenance burden of keeping multiple documents in sync

**Current Documentation:**
- See `/proj/CHANGELOG.md` for consolidated fix history
- See `/proj/FRESH_START_PLAN.md` for current project status
- See `/proj/GROUP_MEMBERS_FEATURE.md` for feature documentation
